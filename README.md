# My upcoming projects through Merit America:
  #### ✅ SQL Project — BigQuery Homelessness Analysis
🔗 **Repository:** https://github.com/dsoltez/bigquery-sql-homelessness-analysis

**Summary:**  
This project explores U.S. homelessness data using Google BigQuery SQL. I analyzed patterns in total homelessness, unsheltered populations, youth homelessness, and state-level differences, then exported the results to CSV and organized them in a structured GitHub repository.

**Dataset Source:**  
BigQuery Public Dataset — `bigquery-public-data.sdoh_hud_pit_homelessness.hud_pit_by_coc`

**Tools Used:**  
- Google BigQuery (SQL querying)
- CSV export for local analysis
- GitHub for version control and organization

**Steps I Took:**  
1. Connected to BigQuery’s public homelessness dataset  
2. Filtered and grouped data by state (2018)  
3. Segmented by total homeless, unsheltered homeless, and youth homeless  
4. Created multiple SQL queries to answer targeted questions  
5. Exported results as CSV  
6. Organized work into `data/`, `sql/`, and `docs/` folders  
7. Summarized insights in the README  

**Findings:**  
- California, New York, and Florida had the highest total homelessness  
- Several states exceeded 1,000 unsheltered individuals, suggesting infrastructure strain  
- Some states had less than 2% unsheltered homelessness, indicating strong shelter systems  
- Youth homelessness concentrated primarily in population-dense states  
- Delaware showed atypical ratios compared to national patterns  

**Future Questions:**  
- How does climate influence unsheltered homelessness?  
- Do shelter investments reduce unsheltered percentages?  
- How do eviction policies affect homelessness trends?  
- How does cost-of-living correlate with total homelessness?

### ✅ Excel Project – NewCo Multi-Channel Marketing Analysis
🔗 **Project Repository:** https://github.com/dsoltez/newco-multichannel-marketing-analysis
**Summary:**  
I used Excel pivot tables, filtering, and visualizations to analyze how different marketing channels and message styles impacted new-customer acquisition for a national retailer.

**Dataset Source:**  
Provided through a BCG X job simulation as campaign performance data.

**Tools Used:**  
Excel (pivot tables, filtering, charts), segmentation, data visualization.

**Steps I Took:**  
1. Cleaned and explored marketing campaign data in Excel  
2. Segmented by new vs. existing customers  
3. Built pivot tables comparing channels and message types  
4. Created charts to visualize performance  
5. Identified insights and business recommendations  

**Findings:**  
- Campaign A performed best for new-customer revenue  
- Email was the strongest acquisition channel  
- Instagram & Web Banner contributed moderate reach value  

**Future Questions:**  
- How would performance vary based on marketing spend?  
- Which demographic segments respond best to each message?  
- How well do newly acquired customers retain over time?
