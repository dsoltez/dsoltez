My upcoming projects through Merit America:
### SQL Project — Coming Soon
### ✅ Excel Project – NewCo Multi-Channel Marketing Analysis
🔗 **Project Repository:** https://github.com/dsoltez/newco-multichannel-marketing-analysis
**Summary:**  
I used Excel pivot tables, filtering, and visualizations to analyze how different marketing channels and message styles impacted new-customer acquisition for a national retailer.

**Dataset Source:**  
Provided through a BCG X job simulation as campaign performance data.

**Tools Used:**  
Excel (pivot tables, filtering, charts), segmentation, data visualization.

**Steps I Took:**  
1. Cleaned and explored marketing campaign data in Excel  
2. Segmented by new vs. existing customers  
3. Built pivot tables comparing channels and message types  
4. Created charts to visualize performance  
5. Identified insights and business recommendations  

**Findings:**  
- Campaign A performed best for new-customer revenue  
- Email was the strongest acquisition channel  
- Instagram & Web Banner contributed moderate reach value  

**Future Questions:**  
- How would performance vary based on marketing spend?  
- Which demographic segments respond best to each message?  
- How well do newly acquired customers retain over time?
### Capstone Project — Coming Soon
